**Abstract.** On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization was notified about a cluster of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in the city of Wuhan, China. Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 24, 2020, 897 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R_0, to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4--3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza. These findings underline the importance of heightened screening, surveillance and control efforts, particularly at airports and other transportation hubs, in order to prevent further international spread of 2019-nCoV.

**Figure.** Proportion of simulated epidemics that lead to a cumulative incidence
 between 1,000 and 9,700 on January 18, 2020. This can be interpreted
 as the combinations of R_0 and k values most compatible with 
epidemic data available on 2019-nCoV as of January 23, 2020. 
As a comparison, we show the estimates of R_0 and k for the 
early human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV in Singapore and 
Beijing, and of 1918 pandemic influenza (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005; 
Fraser et al., 2011; Kucharski et al., 2015).
